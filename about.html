                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Jason Ko, and I typically go by the username Chihorde when I'm gaming. 
                    Feel free to say hello if you see me around the virtual world. 
                    In particular, when playing Gloomhaven, I also use the name Chihorde since this is a game that requires you to name your character. 
                    Unlike some other board games, Gloomhaven allows you to save your progress and pick up where you left off later, making it more like an MMORPG than a one-time game. 
                    I really enjoy playing Gloomhaven and wanted to share my enthusiasm for the game by creating this website.
                </p>

                <h2>Why did I create this website?</h2>
                <p>
                    So, why did I create this website? Well, I believe that the MMORPG-style board game genre is not yet well-known around the world, 
                    and I wanted to use this website, along with Gloomhaven, which is considered one of the best in this genre, 
                    to introduce more people to the joys of this type of game. 
                    One of the best things about Gloomhaven is that it provides an opportunity to gather a group of two to four friends to sit down together for 
                    3-4 hours and enjoy a board game without having to worry about repeating the same content over and over. 
                    This is a cooperative game that requires a lot of strategy and discussion, so you either win or lose together! 
                    I hope that through this website, I can help others discover the fun and excitement of playing Gloomhaven and other MMORPG-style board games.
